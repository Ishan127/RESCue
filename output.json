Step 2 suggests an indirect or metaphorical match \u2014 the operator\u2019s hands are actively holding and adjusting the camera, thus stabilizing it. Step 3 requires outputting a bounding box for this alternative. The operator\u2019s hands are located around the camera mount and tripod head, which is the most relevant area for stabilization via human intervention.
