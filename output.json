The tripod has three legs and a head that holds the camera, and the operator is using it to support the camera. This is the standard equipment used for stabilization in filming. The tripod is clearly visible and is the object that fulfills the description.",

The seeds are the effect, not the cause. The dandelion head is the object that, when disturbed by wind, releases the seeds. Therefore, the dandelion head is the correct target. The small white objects are the seeds, but the object responsible for their dispersal is the dandelion head.
